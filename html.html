			<h3>Dosa</h3>
			Dosa is made by soaking and blending black gram lentils (urad dal) and rice to a batter. Then the fermented batter is spread like a crepe on a hot griddle or tawa. Yes Dosa is a healthy protein rich vegan breakfast.
			<h3>Idly</h3>
			Blend soaked dal,salt and poha adding water as needed until thick and frothy.Grind rice until smooth or coarse to suit your liking. ...Next transfer to a pot. ...After 14 hours, the batter fermented, doubled in volume and had a bubbly texture.		
			<h3>Curd rice</h3>
			Curd rice is a South Indian dish made with precooked rice, Curd (Indian Yogurt) herbs & tempering spices. It is more often eaten by South Indians as a part of the meal, all round the year. Apart from being gut healthy, Curd rice is also a comforting summer food which keeps the body cool.		
			<h3>Tomato rice</h3>
			It is a slightly spicy rice dish that is made with tomato, spices and rice. In the Tamil language, 'thakkali' means tomato and 'sadam' is rice. I love to make a batch of this tomato rice often and serve it for lunch, as it is an ideal dish for packing in a tiffin.
			<h3>parrotta</h3>
			It is prepared by kneading maida/wheat flour, egg (in some recipes), oil or ghee and water. The dough is beaten into thin layers and later forming a round spiralled into a ball using these thin layers. The ball is rolled flat and pan-fried. It is often served with a meat curry, such as chicken, goat, beef, or lamb.</div>
